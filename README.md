I got attached to calling this Guitar Hero Thing. It is a thing, for guitar hero. Well actually, its a thing for Rock Band 3, but same thing.

It lets you add songs to a queue, mostly because using the in-game songlist with a party is hard. 
With signing in, you may add, edit, and delete songs. You do not need to log in to add to the queue.

Here is my planning board along with the frontend backend githubs.

Here is my main front end deploy.

I thank my previous projects, and my previous group project espically with Jake and Mark. Having that previous project really helped me.

I learned a decent amount of backend python from this, even from the lecture in class doing all that made me really learn it. Even if I had to really rush it, I'm surprised I pulled through.

If I had more time, I would have loved for it to display what parts the songs contain, as it is there in the database, just not displayed. Also search, espically if you were to add a lot of songs.
